This is a pixel sorting app. All you have to do is just take a photo or choose existing one from your photo library (or click the cat <- May melt your heart)

After you made your choice, tap the button in lower right corner to proceed.
There are three diffrent effects to choose from, make your decision (or don't) and tap "Process Image", transformed image will appear.
Now you can save it to your photo library.
